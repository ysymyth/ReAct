Thatcherism is a form of British conservative ideology named after Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher that relates to not just her political platform and particular policies but also her personal character and general style of management while in office. Proponents of Thatcherism are referred to as Thatcherites. The term has been used to describe the principles of the British government under Thatcher from the 1979 general election to her resignation in 1990, but it also receives use in describing administrative efforts continuing into the Conservative governments under statesmen John Major and David Cameron throughout the 1990s and 2010s.[1] In international terms, Thatcherites have been described as a part of the general socio-economic movement known as neoliberalism, with different countries besides the United Kingdom (such as the United States) sharing similar policies around expansionary capitalism.[2]. Thatcherism represents a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the post-war consensus inside Great Britain in terms of governance, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, and close regulation of the British economy before Thatcher's rise to prominence.\n",

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease[a] that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles.[2][10][11] ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases.[12][13] Early symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, and gradual increasing weakness and muscle wasting.[2] Limb-onset ALS begins with weakness in the arms or legs, while bulbar-onset ALS begins with difficulty speaking or swallowing.[2][9] Around half of people with ALS develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior, and about 15% develop frontotemporal dementia.[8] Motor neuron loss continues until the ability to eat, speak, move, and finally the ability to breathe is lost[2] with the cause of early death usually being respiratory failure.[14]. Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[2][15] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[16] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS.[15][3] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[2] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[2]. There is no known cure for ALS.[2] The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.[8] A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months.[5] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[4] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression,[17] with death usually caused by respiratory failure.[3] A feeding tube may help.[18] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[3] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than 10 years[4][19][2]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[20] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[20].\n",

Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American computer-animated fantasy streaming television series created by Guillermo del Toro and produced by DreamWorks Animation Television and Double Dare You Productions for Netflix, based on the 2015 novel Trollhunters by del Toro and Daniel Kraus.[2] It follows the story of James \"Jim\" Lake Jr., a teenage boy who finds a mysterious amulet and stumbles across a secret realm inhabited by trolls and other magical creatures. Soon afterward, he and his friends are charged with protecting the world from the dangerous monsters that lurk in the shadows of their small suburban town.. The first two episodes of the series premiered on October 8, 2016, at the New York Comic Con.[1][3] The first season was released worldwide on Netflix on December 23, 2016.[4] The second season premiered on December 15, 2017,[5][6] and the third and final season premiered on May 25, 2018.[7][8]. Since its release, Trollhunters has been widely praised as an ambitious and boundary-pushing animated series.[9]  The series was nominated for nine Daytime Emmy Awards in 2017, winning more than any other animated or live-action television program that year.[10] In its first three seasons, it has also received or been nominated for a BAFTA Award, several Annie Awards, Kidscreen Awards, Golden Reel Awards, and a Saturn Award.\n",

Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).\n",

Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD.[10]. The English largely descend from two main historical population groups: the West Germanic tribes, including the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians who settled in Southern Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans, and the partially Romanised Celtic Britons who already lived there.[11][12][13][14] Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons, they founded what was to become the Kingdom of England by the early 10th century, in response to the invasion and extensive settlement of Danes that began in the late 9th century.[15][16] This was followed by the Norman Conquest and limited settlement of Normans in England in the later 11th century.[17][18][19][11][20] Some definitions of English people include, while others exclude, people descended from later migration into England.[21].

Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals.

The event partially took place, the story is partially set, and the film was partially shot in Sugar Land, Texas.[4] Other scenes for the film were filmed in San Antonio, Live Oak, Floresville, Pleasanton, Converse and Del Rio, Texas.[5]. The Sugarland Express marks the first collaboration between Spielberg and composer John Williams, who has scored all but five of Spielberg-directed films since; this is the only score he has composed for Spielberg that has never been released as an album, although Williams re-recorded the main theme with Toots Thielemans and the Boston Pops Orchestra for 1991's The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration.[6].

Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).\n",

      "Observation 1: Pages for logged out editors learn more. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease[a] that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles.[2][10][11] ALS is the most common form of the motor neuron diseases.[12][13] Early symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, and gradual increasing weakness and muscle wasting.[2] Limb-onset ALS begins with weakness in the arms or legs, while bulbar-onset ALS begins with difficulty speaking or swallowing.[2][9] Around half of people with ALS develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior, and about 15% develop frontotemporal dementia.[8] Motor neuron loss continues until the ability to eat, speak, move, and finally the ability to breathe is lost[2] with the cause of early death usually being respiratory failure.[14]. Most cases of ALS (about 90% to 95%) have no known cause, and are known as sporadic ALS.[2][15] However, both genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved.[16] The remaining 5% to 10% of cases have a genetic cause linked to a history of the disease in the family, and these are known as familial ALS.[15][3] About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes.[2] The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[2]. There is no known cure for ALS.[2] The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms.[8] A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months.[5] Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life.[4] Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression,[17] with death usually caused by respiratory failure.[3] A feeding tube may help.[18] The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60.[3] The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary, and about 10% survive longer than 10 years[4][19][2]. Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[20] In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems was first described by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[20].\n",

Muscarinic receptors are so named because they are more sensitive to muscarine than to nicotine.[2] Their counterparts are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), receptor ion channels that are also important in the autonomic nervous system.

Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.[2] Though this phrase praises the quality of his early manga works for children and animations, it also blurs the significant influence of his later, more literary, gekiga works..

As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3].

It also affected modern British popular culture significantly through its books concerning politics, the arts, and science.[6]. Penguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House, a conglomerate formed in 2013 by its merger with American publisher Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.[7] Formerly, Penguin Group was wholly owned by British Pearson plc, the global media company which also owned the Financial Times.[8] When Penguin Random House was formed, Pearson had a 47% stake in the new company, which was reduced to 25% in July 2017.\n",

Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade, and eventually came under the Ajuran Empire in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence..\n",

Australia is the oldest,[15] flattest,[16] and driest inhabited continent,[17][18] with the least fertile soils.[19][20] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east.. The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south east Asia approximately 65,000 years ago, during the last ice age.[21][22] Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.[21] Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia.

The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.[4] The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against the budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations from multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and two Golden Globes.[5] The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[6] and the National Board of Review selected it as the best of 2007.[7].\n",

Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a national memorial centered on a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore (Lakota: Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe, or Six Grandfathers[2]) in the Black Hills near Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum.[3][4] The sculpture features the 60-foot-tall (18 m) heads of four United States Presidents recommended by Borglum: George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865).[5] The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development and preservation, respectively.[6] The memorial park covers 1,278 acres (2.00 sq mi; 5.17 km2)[7] and the mountain itself has an elevation of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level.[8]. The sculptor and tribal representatives settled on Mount Rushmore,[clarification needed] which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Doane Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud,[9] Buffalo Bill Cody,[10] and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse.[11] Borglum believed that the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents..\n",

In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles.[4][5] Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.[6] Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while most reptiles have three chambers.[5] In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow.[3] The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.[7].\n",

The Meteora (/ˌmɛtiˈɔːrə/;[1] Greek: Μετέωρα, pronounced [meˈteora]) is a rock formation in central Greece hosting one of the largest and most precipitously built complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries, second in importance only to Mount Athos.[2] The six (of an original twenty-four) monasteries are built on immense natural pillars and hill-like rounded boulders that dominate the local area. Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the twenty-four monasteries were established atop the rocks.[3] Meteora is located near the town of Kalabaka at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the Pineios river and Pindus Mountains.[4]. Meteora was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988 because of the outstanding architecture and beauty of the complex, in addition to its religious and artistic significance.[5]. The name means \"lofty\", \"elevated\", and is etymologically related to meteor.[6].\n",

Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate's sphere of influence..\n",

The UN Charter mandates the UN and its member states to maintain international peace and security, uphold international law, achieve \"higher standards of living\" for their citizens, address \"economic, social, health, and related problems\", and promote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\".[2] As a charter and constituent treaty, its rules and obligations are binding on all members and supersede those of other treaties.[1][3]. During the Second World War, the Allies—formally known as the United Nations—agreed to establish a new postwar international organization.[4] Pursuant to this goal, the UN Charter was discussed, prepared, and drafted during the San Francisco Conference that began 25 April 1945, which involved most of the world's sovereign nations.[5] Following two-thirds approval of each part, the final text was unanimously adopted by delegates and opened for signature on 26 June 1945;[6][7] it was signed in San Francisco, United States, by 50 of the 51 original member countries.[6][Note 1]. The Charter entered into force on 24 October 1945, following ratification by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China,[Note 2] France,[Note 3] the Soviet Union,[Note 4] the United Kingdom, and the United States—and a majority of the other signatories; this is considered the official starting date of the United Nations, with the first session of the General Assembly, representing all 51 initial members, opening in London the following January.\n",

After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014,[5] Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming Prime Minister the following year.[6] At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become Prime Minister, became the youngest person to have served as Prime Minister.[7] While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth,[8] a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions,[9] and the abolition of many small taxes.[10]. After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum,[11][12] Renzi formally resigned as Prime Minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement.[13][14] He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election.[15] In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the IV party.[16] In January 2021, Renzi revoked IV's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis.[17] In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government.[18] Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.[19][20][21].\n",

The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"Year of the Four Emperors\" over the imperial succession.. Originally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions.\n",

It stars Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor and is a pastiche of the early-1960s American \"no-sex sex comedies\",[4] such as Pillow Talk and Lover Come Back (both starring Rock Hudson, Doris Day, and Tony Randall) and the \"myriad spawn\"[5] of derivative films that followed; Time film critic Richard Corliss wrote that Down with Love \"is so clogged with specific references to a half-dozen Rock-and-Doris-type comedies that it serves as definitive distillation of the genre.\"[4] Randall himself plays a small role in Down with Love, \"bestowing his sly, patriarchal blessing\"[6] on the film, which also stars David Hyde Pierce (in the neurotic best friend role often played by Randall or Gig Young), Sarah Paulson, Rachel Dratch, Jeri Ryan, and Jack Plotnick, who spoofs the kind of role Chet Stratton played in Lover Come Back.. Typical of the genre, the film tells the story of a woman who advocates female independence in combat with a lothario; the plot reflects the attitudes and behaviour of the early pre-sexual revolution 1960s but has an anachronistic conclusion driven by more modern, post-feminist ideas and attitudes..

Human trafficking is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation.[9] Human trafficking is the trade in people, especially women and children, and does not necessarily involve the movement of the person from one place to another.[10][11]. People smuggling (also called human smuggling and migrant smuggling) is a related practice which is characterized by the consent of the person being smuggled.[12] Smuggling situations can descend into human trafficking through coercion and exploitation.[13] Trafficked people are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others.. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), forced labour alone (one component of human trafficking) generates an estimated $150 billion in profits per annum as of 2014.[14] In 2012, the ILO estimated that 21 million victims are trapped in modern-day slavery.\n",

Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the twenty-four monasteries were established atop the rocks.[3] Meteora is located near the town of Kalabaka at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the Pineios river and Pindus Mountains.[4]. Meteora was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988 because of the outstanding architecture and beauty of the complex, in addition to its religious and artistic significance.[5].

      "Observation 1: Pages for logged out editors learn more. No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western crime thriller film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name.[1] Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, the film is set in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas.[2] The film revisits the themes of fate, conscience, and circumstance that the Coen brothers had explored in the films Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), and Fargo (1996).[3] The film follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a Vietnam War veteran and welder who stumbles upon a large sum of money in the desert; Anton Chigurh (Bardem), a hitman who is tasked with recovering the money; and Ed Tom Bell (Jones), a local sheriff investigating the crime. The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million.. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19.[4] The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against the budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations from multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards (including Best Picture), three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and two Golden Globes.[5] The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[6] and the National Board of Review selected it as the best of 2007.[7].\n",

The geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention,[3] depicts the large spans of time from the beginning of the Earth to the present, and its divisions chronicle some definitive events of Earth history. (In the graphic, Ma means \"million years ago\".) Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula.[4][5][6] Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen.

Although it was grouped among the comedies,[1] many modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.[2]. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1753 and published in 1756).\n",

Melancholia or melancholy (from Greek: µέλαινα χολή melaina chole,[1] meaning black bile)[2] is a concept found throughout ancient, medieval and premodern medicine in Europe that describes a condition characterized by markedly  depressed mood, bodily complaints, and sometimes hallucinations and delusions.. Melancholy was regarded as one of the four temperaments matching the four humours.[3] Until the 18th century, doctors and other scholars classified melancholic conditions as such by their perceived common cause – an excess of a notional fluid known as \"black bile\", which was commonly linked to the spleen.. Between the late 18th and late 19th centuries, melancholia was a common medical diagnosis, [4] and modern concepts of depression as a mood disorder eventually arose from this historical context.[5]. Related terms used in historical medicine include lugubriousness (from Latin lugere: \"to mourn\"),[6][7] moroseness (from Latin morosus: \"self-will or fastidious habit\"),[7][8] wistfulness (from a blend of \"wishful\" and the obsolete English wistly, meaning \"intently\"),[7][9] and saturnineness (from Latin Saturninus: \"of the planet Saturn).[10][11].\n",

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 14 Coppa Italia titles and nine Supercoppa Italiana titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup.[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited..

Poseidon (/pəˈsaɪdən, pɒ-, poʊ-/;[1] Greek: Ποσειδῶν) was one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and mythology, presiding over the sea, storms, earthquakes and horses.[2] He was the protector of seafarers and the guardian of many Hellenic cities and colonies. In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, Poseidon was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes, with the cult title \"earth shaker\";[2] in the myths of isolated Arcadia, he is related to Demeter and Persephone and was venerated as a horse, and as a god of the waters.[3] Poseidon maintained both associations among most Greeks: He was regarded as the tamer or father of horses,[2] who, with a strike of his trident, created springs (in the Greek language, the terms for both are related).[4] His Roman equivalent is Neptune.. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when, following the overthrow of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among Cronus' three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three.[2][5] In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War; in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon's fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, causing the complete loss of his ship and companions, and delaying his return by ten years. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn.\n",

Tamerlan Anzorovich Tsarnaev (/ˌtæmərˈlɑːn ˌtsɑːrˈnaɪɛf/; October 21, 1986 – April 19, 2013)[note 1] was an American-based Chechen terrorist and former boxer of Chechen and Avar descent [3][4] who, with his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, planted pressure cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013.[1][5][6][7] The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others.[8] He emigrated to the United States in 2004 at the age of 18.[9] At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was an aspiring boxer.[10]. Shortly after the Federal Bureau of Investigation declared them suspects in the bombings and released images of them, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT policeman, carjacked an SUV, and engaged in a shootout with the police in the Boston suburb of Watertown. According to the federal indictment, during the shootout, Tamerlan was captured but died, partly as a result of his brother driving over him, and an MBTA police officer was critically injured in the course of Dzhokhar's escape in the SUV,[11] the latter by what may have been friendly fire.[12] An injured Dzhokhar escaped, but was found, arrested, and hospitalized on the evening of April 19 after an unprecedented manhunt in which thousands of police officials searched a 20-block area of Watertown.[13]. During his incarceration, Tsarnaev's brother allegedly said during questioning that the pair next intended to detonate explosives in Times Square in New York City.[14] Dzhokhar reportedly told authorities that he and his brother were radicalized, at least in part, by watching lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki.[15].\n",

Sikhism (/ˈsɪkɪzəm/), also known as Sikhi (Punjabi: ਸਿੱਖੀ Sikkhī, [ˈsɪkʰiː], from ਸਿੱਖ, Sikh, 'disciple', 'seeker', or 'learner'),[i] is a religion and philosophy[2] that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent,[ii][3] around the end of the 15th century CE.[4][5][6][7][8][9] It is the most recently founded major organized faith and stands at fifth-largest worldwide,[10][11][12] with about 25–30 million adherents (known as Sikhs) as of the early 21st century[update].[13][14]. Sikhism developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the faith's first guru,[15] and the nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Gobind Singh (1666–1708), named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, bringing to a close the line of human gurus and establishing the scripture as the 11th and last eternally living guru, a religious spiritual/life guide for Sikhs.[16][17][18] Guru Nanak taught that living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" is above metaphysical truth, and that the ideal man \"establishes union with God, knows His Will, and carries out that Will\".[19] Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru (1606–1644), established the concept of mutual co-existence of the miri ('political'/'temporal') and piri ('spiritual') realms.[20]. The Sikh scripture opens with the Mul Mantar or alternatively spelled \"Mool Mantar\" (ਮੂਲ ਮੰਤਰ), fundamental prayer about ik onkar (ੴ, 'One God').[21][22] The core beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator; divine unity and equality of all humankind; engaging in seva ('selfless service'); striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all; and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life.[23][24][25] Following this standard, Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on Absolute Truth.[iii][26] Sikhism emphasizes simran (ਸਿਮਰਨ, meditation and remembrance of the teachings of Gurus),[27] which can be expressed musically through kirtan, or internally through naam japna ('meditation on His name') as a means to feel God's presence.\n",
